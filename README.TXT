Complete the PiggyBank class so the program yields the same output 
as the demo program.  

An object of type PiggyBank contains an instance ArrayList to hold the
Coin objects.

Your task is to complete the methods removeCoin() and sortCoins()
by providing the implementation for removeCoin() and the comment
for sortCoins()

DO NOT MODIFY the PiggyBankMain, CoinGUI or Coin classes
